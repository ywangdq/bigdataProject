New York Times Covid-19 Cases,New York Times,https://github.com/nytimes/covid-19-data,United States,New York,Day,2020/1/21,2020/4/24,Country and State,"The New York Times is releasing a series of data files with 
cumulative counts of coronavirus cases in the United States, at the 
state and county level, over time. We are compiling this time series 
data from state and local governments and health departments in an 
attempt to provide a complete record of the ongoing outbreak.
Since late January, The Times has tracked cases of coronavirus in 
real time as they were identified after testing. Because of the 
widespread shortage of testing, however, the data is necessarily limited
 in the picture it presents of the outbreak.
We have used this data to power our maps and reporting
 tracking the outbreak, and it is now being made available to the public
 in response to requests from researchers, scientists and government 
officials who would like access to the data to better understand the 
outbreak.","COVID-19, New York Times, USA"
